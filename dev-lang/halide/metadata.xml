		Halide is a programming language designed to make it easier
		to write high-performance image and array processing code
		on modern machines. Halide currently targets:

		    CPU architectures: X86, ARM, MIPS, Hexagon, PowerPC
		    Operating systems: Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, Android,
		        iOS, Qualcomm QuRT
		    GPU Compute APIs: CUDA, OpenCL, OpenGL, OpenGL Compute
		        Shaders, Apple Metal, Microsoft Direct X 12

		Rather than being a standalone programming language, Halide
		is embedded in C++. This means you write C++ code that
		builds an in-memory representation of a Halide pipeline
		using Halide's C++ API. You can then compile this
		representation to an object file, or JIT-compile it and run
		it in the same process. Halide also provides a Python
		binding that provides full support for writing Halide
		embedded in Python without C++.
